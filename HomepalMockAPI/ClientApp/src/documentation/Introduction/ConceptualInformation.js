              Each object in the simplified ontology represents a{" "}

            <p>
              The database behind the Homebase API has properties that
              developers should consider when using the API.
            </p>
            <p>
              All objects have a unique identifier, which <b>cannot</b> be
              modified.
            </p>
            <p>
              The database is built on a <b>foreign key</b> structure. This
              means that objects in the API often are related to other objects
              based on the <b>unique identifier</b> present in the related
              object.
            </p>

            <p>
              An example of this is <span className="code-badge">Leasable</span>
              , which has three separate foreign keys that relate the object to
              other resources in the API. In the example to the right, the
              attributes: <span className="code-badge">customer_id</span>,{" "}
              <span className="code-badge">owner_id</span> and{" "}
              <span className="code-badge">building_id</span> reference other
              objects from other resources in the API.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means, that in order to <b>create</b> a new{" "}
              <span className="code-badge">Leasable</span>, and other objects
              with foreign keys, these attributes must be defined, and must
              reference already existing objects in the API.
            </p>
            <p>
              This foreign key structure also ensures that the database is
              consistent, by leveraging <b>cascading changes</b>. If an object,
              higher up in the hierarchy, like{" "}
              <span className="code-badge">Building</span>, is deleted. Objects
              from other resources, like{" "}
              <span className="code-badge">Leasables</span>, that reference the
              deleted object, will also be deleted.

              Some resources have <b>enumerated values</b>. Essentially, this
              means that an attribute for an object can be one of several,
              predetermined options.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where applicable, these enumerated values will be listed along
