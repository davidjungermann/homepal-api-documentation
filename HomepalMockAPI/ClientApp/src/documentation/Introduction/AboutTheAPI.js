              The documentation starts of by describing general information
              about the API that is always applied, and is later organized by
              resource type of the API. For each resource, the documentation
              lists:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>the available endpoints,</li>
              <li>body and path schemas for available endpoints,</li>
              <li>information on what an endpoint returns,</li>
              <li>response and request body examples,</li>
              <li>usage examples for available endpoints</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Conceptual information concerning a given resource, along with
              descriptions of body and path schemas, and information on what a
              given endpoint returns is always presented in the left column.
              Endpoints, response and request body examples, as well as usage
              examples are always presented in the right column.

              every now and then, and endpoints are deprecated. If you are using
