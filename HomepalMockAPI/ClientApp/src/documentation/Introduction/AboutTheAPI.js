              The documentation starts of by describing general information
              about the API that is always applied, and is later organized by
              resource type of the API. For each resource type, the
              documentation lists:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>the available endpoints,</li>
              <li>one or more data representations,</li>
              <li>JSON objects,</li>
              <li>the supported methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE),</li>
              <li>at least one usage example.</li>
            </ul>

              every now and then, and endpoints are deprecated. If you are using
